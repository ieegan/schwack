# Schwack

Project is made with VueJS as a small framework.
https://vuejs.org/

And also Axios
https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios

To fetch json data. But you can use your backend to push data via json as well.

Some instructions will be commented out in the files directly.

## How to install

Just clone and open on a web server.

Might no load when opened on a web browser directly as File is not in the protocol schemes supported for cross origin requests.

Do not use the code as is. I broke down the .php files for ease. This is not meant to be used directly on the server. Impliment own routing or framework. This is only meant to be a CSS / Javascript / HTML template.

## How to Use

Open required link.

Navigate to source.

Copy all required files and connect to framework.
